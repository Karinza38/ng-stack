 # @ng-stack

This Angular library contains two projects:
- [@ng-stack/forms](./projects/forms) - provides wrapped Angular's Reactive Forms to write its more strongly typed.
- [@ng-stack/contenteditable](./projects/contenteditable) - a micro Angular v4+ contenteditable directive for integration with Angular forms. It just implements [ControlValueAccessor](https://angular.io/api/forms/ControlValueAccessor) for this purpose.
